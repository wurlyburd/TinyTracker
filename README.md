# Tinytracker - Tinyman LP Tracker

Tracks your gains and losses in Tinyman pools. This code was created as a way for me to learn Python and GitHub. As such, there may be errors as I continue to learn.

The files were created using:

**python 3.9.0**

<a href="https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk">**py-algorand-sdk 1.9.0b1**</a>

<a href="https://github.com/tinymanorg/tinyman-py-sdk">**tinyman-py-sdk 0.0.4**</a>
